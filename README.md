Title:  The Botolan Sambal Dictionary Project
Description: 
This is an online center for public development of the Botolan Sambal dictionary. Users (who have accounts) contribute by correcting entries or adding new entries.
The main tools are:
  1. Sambal word search that returns a current entry on the dictionary unless it doesn't exist at which a message will flag and ask the searcher if s/he wants to add the word.
  2. Tagalog word search that returns Sambal entries from the dictionary that match the Tagalog gloss
  3. English word search that returns Sambal entries from the dictionary that match the English gloss.

Links to the following commence on the home page:
  1. Information page about the project.
  2. Grammatical sketch of Botolan Sambal.
  3. Contact form to reach the administrator of the project
  4. Volunteer form which returns an account login which has permission to add/modify/delete entries in the dictionary database.
