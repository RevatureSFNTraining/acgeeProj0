Title of Project0:  The Botolan Sambal Dictionary Project

Project Description:
This website updates and further develops an existing dictionary database of Sambal words with glosses in English and Tagalaog. Botolan Sambal is a minority language in the Philippines where Tagalog and English are official languages. Tagalog is the national language.

The purpose of the dictionary project is twofold:
  1. to update an existing dictionary and correct errors
  2. to use the changing dictionary for computer-assisted translation also on the web for a future project.

A word entry at the most basic level consists of the following:
  1. word
  2. IPA phonetic transcription
  3. recording of the pronunciation
  4. gloss in English
  5. gloss in Tagalog
  6. part of speech
  7. root word
  8. definition in English
  9. definition in Tagalog
  10. example sentence
  11. translated sentence in English
  12. translated sentence in Tagalog
  13. photo or illustration (optional)
  14. source (name of contributor)
  
Users with login accounts can edit entries.  Volunteer users need approval of the administrator but will be allowed to edit through restricted guest accounts.

The tools on the website are:
  1. Sambal word search that displays the current entries by page
  2. Reverse word search from English that returns all Sambal dictionary entries with the English gloss
  3. Reverse word search from Tagalog that returns all Sambal dictionary entries with the English gloss
  4. Form to edit entries
  5. Form to volunteer as a contributor
